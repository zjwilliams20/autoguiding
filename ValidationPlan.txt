Validation Plan
_______________________________

Tasks:
    + attach a USB Camera to the finder scope
    + take multiple pictures of the sky to simulate a live capture
    + interface the USB Camera to the autoguiding program on the host PC
    + apply guiding algorithms to output motor instructions

Additional Accomplishments:
    + four test simulations created containing 10 images each
    + primitive gui for user to watch live progress of autoguiding
    + visual-logging file to see each image in the sequence
    + autoselection algorithm to find a star from the center
    + CentroidTracker class to keep track of all stars in the image
